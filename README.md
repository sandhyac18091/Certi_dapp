## ðŸ§¾ Introduction

**CertiDApp** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to issue, store, and verify digital certificates on the blockchain. It offers a secure and tamper-proof solution for organizations such as universities, training institutes, and companies to provide verifiable credentials to their users.
Using blockchain and smart contracts, CertiDApp ensures that each certificate is uniquely identifiable and cannot be forged or altered. Each certificate is assigned a **Certificate ID**, which can be used to retrieve and verify its authenticity at any time. The platform also generates a **QR code** for each certificate, enabling instant access to verification by simply scanning the code.
CertiDApp simplifies certificate management while enhancing trust and transparency in digital credential systems.
